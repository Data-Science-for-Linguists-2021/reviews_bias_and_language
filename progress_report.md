### Report 1
### Report 2

I've finished the work of transforming the data into a form I can use for my project. This included converting the dataset into dataframes, filtering out data that I don't need, and creating a new dataframe made up of sentences tagged by restaurant id, stars, text, and the cuisine of the restaurant being reviewed. I've also designed an annotation schema for the next stage of my project, separating sentences into theme using a classifier (food, service, atmosphere) with one category for 'other' and another for sentences mentioning multiple factors. This should give me more data to run analysis on and allow me to look at the issue of bias in restaurant reviews with a finer grain.


Sharing data:
The Yelp Dataset's license has many limitations for what is allowed to be done with the data. Two of them are as follows:
a.publicly display, perform, or distribute any of the Data;
b.distribute the Data to any other person;
I'll need to speak to Na-Rae about this, as this seems like a very absolute statement. I'm not sure if simply posting a Jupyter notebook with text from the dataset saved in a dataframe will violate it, or if posting a sample of the data would violate it. Hopefully this problem won't prevent me from doing anything I need for the project.
My License:
I'm a passionate supporter of open-source software and open data, so I wanted to use the most permissive license I could. The GNU General Public License v3.0 is perfect for this as a 'copyleft' license. However, I should look up more about it to see if I need to add special terms relating to the Yelp dataset, since they would be held to the same terms as me.
